  title:[CVE-2016-5385]  Improper Access Control
  description:PHP through 7.0.8 does not attempt to address RFC 3875 section 4.1.18 namespace conflicts and therefore does not protect applications from the presence of untrusted client data in the HTTP_PROXY environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to redirect an application's outbound HTTP traffic to an arbitrary proxy server via a crafted Proxy header in an HTTP request, as demonstrated by (1) an application that makes a getenv('HTTP_PROXY') call or (2) a CGI configuration of PHP, aka an "httpoxy" issue.

## Development notes

* PHP version - **7.4+ required**

  On macos, while `php` was already installed, 
    ```
    $ php --version
    PHP 7.3.11 (cli) (built: Jun  5 2020 23:50:40) ( NTS )
    Copyright (c) 1997-2018 The PHP Group
    Zend Engine v3.3.11, Copyright (c) 1998-2018 Zend Technologies
    ```
    we need a newer version of `php`: at least 7.4. To install this, I ran the following commands:
    ```
    brew update
    brew install php
    ```
    This installed `php 7.4` into: `/usr/local/Cellar/php/7.4.11`. In order to ensure this new version of
    php would be found before the macos pre-installed version, I prepended the new php `bin` folder to my path via:
    ```
    export PATH=/usr/local/Cellar/php/7.4.11/bin:$PATH
    ``` 
    Ensure the intended version will be used by running:
    ```
    $ php --version
    PHP 7.4.11 (cli) (built: Oct  1 2020 23:30:54) ( NTS )
    Copyright (c) The PHP Group
    Zend Engine v3.4.0, Copyright (c) Zend Technologies
        with Zend OPcache v7.4.11, Copyright (c), by Zend Technologies
    ```
  
* Composer

    I also had to do a one time install of [composer](https://getcomposer.org) using [brew](https://brew.sh) on macos:
    ```
    brew install composer
    ``` 
    
    After running `composer install`, I could run unit tests using:
    ```
    vendor/bin/phpunit tests
    ```
    I'm not sure it is actually needed, but while updating `brew` and things, I ran into a case that
    needed access to write to my local `bin` folders, and had to follow these steps to temporarily 
    disable `csrutil`. see: https://www.imore.com/how-turn-system-integrity-protection-macos.
    Be sure to undo such changes if you need 'em.
  
* You can cleanup `composer.lock` (remove stale dependencies from the `composer.lock` file)
using the command:
  ```
  composer update
  ```

* If you need to add new dependencies, I found the following commands would
ensure the new dependency was installed and available to unit tests, etc:
  ```
  composer update
  composer install
  vendor/bin/phpunit tests
  ```
